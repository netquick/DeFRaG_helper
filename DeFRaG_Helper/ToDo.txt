- Data logic: 
	- first count all maps to have a number
	- load the history list
	- load the maps from history first
	- load a certain amount from the database, maybe load newest maps first, then show the views and count as "loaded"
	- update the maplist and parse new released maps (caution: need save back to db)
	- load the rest from the database
